# DESCRIPTION

If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen!  This cooking simulator game developed in Unity will pit 2 players against each other in couch co-op madness!!  Can you keep your customers happy by serving them meals quickly while outpacing your opponent?!

# HOW TO PLAY

The rules are simple.  Customers sit in front of tables at the top of the screen, and above them they will show the ingredients for the meal you want.  Your job is to deliver them that meal before time runs out!  Each customer has only so much patience, so deliver your meals before the bar above them runs out or they will leave!

To assemble a meal...

1. Pick up an ingredient from one of the side tables by walking next to it and hitting the **action** button.  (You can carry 2 ingredients at a time)
2. Once you have ingredients in hand, bring them to the chopping station, and hit the **action** button again to place it on the chopping board.
3. If an unchopped ingredient is placed on the chopping board, press the **action** button to begin chopping it. (You can't chop if you're still carrying ingredients, put extra ingredients on the plate, or throw them in the trash).
4. Once one ingreident has been chopped, you can place and chop again to build the combinations your customers are looking for.
5. If you aren't carrying any ingredients, you can pick up chopped ingredients off the chopping block by hitting the **action** button.
6. With chopped ingredients in hand, walk over to a customer table, and while standing in front of it, press the **action** button again to deliver your meal.
7. Repeat until time runs out!!  You can get bonuses including additional time by delivering meals quickly!!
